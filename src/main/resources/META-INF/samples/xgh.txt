{"id": 12, "title": "Always believe in improvement promises.", "description": "Putting TODO comments in the code as a promise that the code will be improved later helps the XGH developer. He/She won't feel guilt for the shit he/she did. Sure there won't be no refactoring (see Axiom 10)." }

Don't try to put order into XGH (see Axiom 16). It's useless and you'll spend a lot of precious time. This will make things go down even faster. Don't try to manage XGH as it's auto-sufficient (see Axiom 11) as it's also chaos." }

If you start something using XGH and then turn to some trendy methodology you will be fucked up. XGH doesn't allow refactoring (see Axiom 10) and your new sissy system will collapse. When that happens only XGH can save you." }
{"id": 19, "title": "If it's working don't bother.", "description": "Never ever change - or even think of question - a working code. That's a complete waste of time even more because refactoring doesn't exist (see Axiom 10). Time is the engine behind XGH and quality is just a meaningless detail." }
{"id": 20, "title": "Tests are for pussies.", "description": "If you ever worked with XGH you better know what you're doing. And if you know what you're doing why test then? Tests are a waste of time. If it compiles it's good." }
